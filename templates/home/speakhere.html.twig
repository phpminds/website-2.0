        <p>We are always on the look out for speakers - and welcome talk submissions from all regardless
            of previous experience.
            Concerned that your 'not the expert', no worries, you'd be surprised I am sure at what you know
            and the benefit you can bring from sharing your experiences with others.
            We have been to many events and spoken ourselves, we understand. We can help you with your talk and
            provide a supportive environment, where it is needed so please contact us and discuss your ideas. We
            also welcome tutorial and workshop style ideas.
